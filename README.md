# 🛒 Web_Scraper

**Web_Scraper** is a simple and snappy desktop tool that extracts useful information—such as **Title**, **Price**, **Rating**, and the **About** section—from a product's webpage. Just drop in the URL, click Submit, and boom—clean product details in seconds!

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- 🖥️ **Frontend**: Tkinter for a simple and responsive GUI  
- 🧠 **Backend**: Python (because... obviously 🐍)  
- 🌐 **Web requests**: `requests` for fetching HTML content  
- 🧹 **Data parsing**: `lxml` for extracting clean data from the page

## 💡 How It Works

1. Paste the product URL into the app  
2. Click **Submit**  
3. Instantly see:  
   - Product Title  
   - Price (if available)  
   - Rating  
   - About section or description  

It’s fast, distraction-free, and runs right from your desktop—no need to open a browser or dig through cluttered web pages.
